    "description": "The absolute gear to protect its wearer against the untouchable reach of Hadum was crafted by the Ancient Kingdom of Orzeca, which wrought its own ruin.\n\n\"The incarnation of greed exists in this world. Even Hadum is no exception before the all-consuming incarnation of greed\"\n\nThe Orzecans crafted the absolute gear imbued with the power of the Thornwood goddess in the shape of the legendary Incarnation of Greed mentioned in the prophesy of Cantarnia, the genius architect and founder of Orzeca.\nHowever, once Orzeca fell, graverobbers who sought after the gear found it buried in the ruins, stole the power of the Thornwood goddess for themselves,\nhalved the dead Divine Tree Quturan's lungs, stored each part with the power and fled, only to have the two lungs change masters countless times over the years.\n\nTime passed, and the Ahibs arrived in O'dyllita, the Arid Land. In the Crypt of Resting Thoughts they discovered the above records along with the absolute gear inspired by the incarnation of greed.\n\nThe Ahibs named the absolute gear, now a mere shell of its former glory, as the La Orzeca Helmet and La Orzeca Armor.",
